Stubble
=======

Stubble allows sleep-deprived developers to earn through the peer-to-peer currency that is: Bitcoin. Sorry that the name is male-oriented (or may be). It searches your machine for the fingerprints of known software packages that accept bitcoin donations and generates QR codes for an inputted amount of bitcoins.

A screenshot of the interface is available on Imgur: http://i.imgur.com/B1Q5FwC.png.
