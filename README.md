Stubble
=======

Stubble allows sleep-deprived developers to earn through the peer-to-peer currency that is: Bitcoin. Sorry that the name is male-oriented (or may be). It searches your machine for the fingerprints of known software packages that accept bitcoin donations and generates QR codes for an inputted amount of bitcoins.

A screenshot of the interface is available on Imgur: http://imgur.com/o9RIiiE

At current writing, Stubble allows a user to do the following:

1) Donate bitcoin to Bitcoin Foundation

2) Donate bitcoin to Blender

3) Donate bitcoin to FileZilla

4) Donate bitcoin to Gimp

5) Donate bitcoin to LibreOffice

6) Donate bitcoin to Multibit

7) Donate bitcoin to Notepad++

8) Donate bitcoin to Synergy

9) Donate bitcoin to VLC

10) Donate bitcoin to TOR

Users are allowed to check out and expand this list, as well as remove entries from this list, if anyone decides to "get smart" and tries to put his own bitcoin address in place of any popular softwares.
